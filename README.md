# 🧠 Student Stress Prediction using Machine Learning

A Machine Learning project that predicts student stress levels based on academic and lifestyle factors using a Decision Tree classifier.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Stress among students is a growing concern.  
This project analyzes key features such as:

- Study Hours  
- Sleep Duration  
- Academic Pressure  
- Social Interaction  
- Screen Time  

and predicts the **stress level (Low / Medium / High)** using a supervised ML model.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- Python 3.12  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Decision Tree Classifier

## 📊 Model Details

## 📊 Model Evaluation

- Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier  
- Train-Test Split: 80/20  
- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix Visualization  

The confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of model performance across stress levels (Low / Medium / High), allowing better understanding beyond accuracy alone.

## 📈 Output

- Prints model accuracy
- Displays confusion matrix heatmap
- Predicts stress level for sample input
